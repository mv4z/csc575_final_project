# CSC 575 Final Project

## Introduction

This project is an implementation of an Information Retrieval system which makes use of different components such as inverted index, TF-IDF weighted term-document matrices, query expansion, and more to present the user with the most relevant documents to one of their queries.

## Dataset

This is a text-based dataset used for information retrieval, publicly available from the University of Glasgowâ€™s Information Retrieval Group. The data was compiled by the Centre for Inventions and Scientific Information (CISI). (Data: [https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/informationretrieval/)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/informationretrieval/)).

## Running

### Virtual environment instructions

Optional, but suggested to avoid package management clashes. Skip to "Running the system".

#### Installing & starting

NOTE: If you have virtualenv installed skip to 3.

1. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal
2. pip3 install virtualenv
3. python3 -m venv venv
4. source env/bin/activate

Use 'deactivate' to exit the virtual environment.

### Running the system

NOTE: The program will take some time to load on the very first run. The creation and transformation of the term-document matrix is a heavy computation. The TD matrix is saved to the data folder (also created during the first run) in the project and is loaded every time thereafter to reduce the amount of time it takes before a user can enter a query. 

Make sure to run these commands from the project folder in your terminal.

1.\$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2.\$ python3 app.py
